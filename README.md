# State of Emergency
 A first person survival horror game developed using the Godot Engine in GDScript. I came up with the first iterations circa late 2022 and prototyped inside of Unity.
 
* survival horror game primarily inspired by No More Room in Hell and Resident Evil titles
* complete objectives to escape in maps that you can get through in a single 20-40 minute session
* "proper" zombies, romero styled
* low poly retro artstyle, but with nicer lighting and not dragged down by technological limits
* (eventually) native modding tools
*
